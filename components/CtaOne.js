            Online marketing and ad-tech is a privacy nightmare. Google Analytics and other trackers
            follow you on each step around the web and collect information on your behavior. For
            website owners, the dashboard is frustrating to use, hard to understand, and slow. Data
            gets less reliable, as plugins and browsers start to take matters into their own hands,
            blocking invasive scripts by default.

            We set out to solve that problem with a privacy-focused, open-source, and
            easy-to-integrate solution. Grealish respects your visitors privacy. It never tracks
            them across websites nor collects uniquely identifiable information. It offers an
            efficient dashboard to provide actionable, aggregated statistics.
